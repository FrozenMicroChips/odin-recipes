        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>A simple recipe on how to make sweet bread</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 cup milk </li>
            <li> ⅓ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat until slightly warm to the touch then remove from heat and stir in yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Stir together flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add softened butter, eggs, and the yeast mixture and mix until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grease a large bowl with 1 tablespoon oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn once to coat. Cover and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Grease a cookie sheet or 9x13-inch pan with remaining oil.</li>
            <li>For plain rolls, punch down dough and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll the pieces into balls and place them into the greased pan side by side.</li>
            <li>Cover and let dough rise again until almost doubled in size, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
